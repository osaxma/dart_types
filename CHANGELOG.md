## 0.0.4
<!-- WIP: I need to integrate the workflow of `all_subtypes.dart` example into the cli 
          I also wanted to add a commant to collect all subtypes from a project (see `expirement/all_types_and_subtypes`)
          for the latter, currently supertypes from packages are not accessible from `ClassElement.allSupertypes` (not sure if it's an issue)

          Anyway, I found myself wasting a lot of time here so I had to stop and maybe revisit another day.
